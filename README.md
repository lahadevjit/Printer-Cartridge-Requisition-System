# Printer-Cartridge-Requisition-System
A role-based Django web application for managing cartridge and ink requisition requests within an organization.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project is a role-based web application developed using Django to manage cartridge and ink requisitions within an organization. The system digitizes the process of requesting, approving, issuing, and reporting printer cartridge usage.
